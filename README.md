# Model-View-ViewModel (ie MVVM):

## MVVM Best Pratice:
 1. Avoid references to Views in ViewModels.
 2. Instead of pushing data to the UI, let the UI observe changes to it.
 3. Distribute responsibilities, add a domain layer if needed.
 4. Add a data repository as the single-point entry to your data.
 5. Expose information about the state of your data using a wrapper or another LiveData.
 6. Consider edge cases, leaks and how long-running operations can affect the instances in your architecture.
 7. Donâ€™t put logic in the ViewModel that is critical to saving clean state or related to data. Any call you make from a ViewModel can be the last one.
